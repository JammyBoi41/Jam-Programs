Being a CS student, I strive to discover everything I can related to Software Engineering and have been fortunate enough to be given the opportunity to develop some of my own projects as well as working within a team setting with others to contribute towards an end product as well. I'm willing to explore all realms related to the tech industry, hoping to dedicate my persistence and problem-solving ability to an organization who can mutually benefit me with experience and a culture for growth.

It incorporates the Python package <i>sqlite3</i> for storing user information. It makes use of a public database to provide the user with a pre-loaded list of food options to log for convenience, while also allowing them to log custom meals as well. Additionally, it supports Personal Record tracking for the 3 powerlifts, as well as nutritional display for tracking calories and protein intake, all in a custom, simplified interface.

Due to these flight setbacks, our team developed a flight delay calculator using an existing database of flight times in order to calculate average flight delay time between 2 cities as well as their frequency of delay. In order to implement this in an efficient manner, we implemented our own Hash Table and Graph structures to allow for near-instant lookup, allowing for insight into both how likely and how long your flight is likely to be delayed for.
